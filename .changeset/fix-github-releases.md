chore(release): switch publish command to `pnpm exec changeset publish` so `changesets/action` creates GitHub Releases. Raw `npm publish` does not emit the `New tag:` lines the action parses, which silently skipped Release creation for 0.1.0–0.1.4 (npm got them, GitHub Releases page did not). No runtime behavior change.
